e.g in movie Recommendation
step1 calculate the support
support(M) = #user watchlists containing M / #user watchlists

step2 confidence

confidence(M1 -->M2) = # user watchlists containing M1 and M2/ # user watchlists containing M1

step3 lift 

lift(M1 --> M2) = Confidence(M1-->M2) / support(M2)


Apriori - Algorithm

1- Set a minimum support and confidence 
2- Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support
3- Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confidence
4- Sort the rules by decreasing lift 

The rule with highest left is the stronger 

Aproir expect a list of lists with all values as strings
