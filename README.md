# Machine_Learning_Study
This repository shows how i studied Machine Learning topics 

This repository contain the following topics:

1- Supervised machine learning models, including regressing and classification 

2- Unsupervised machine learning models

All the models in this repository, written in 2 forms:

1- Coded from scratch with the help of "Lazyprogrammer" Courses, the github links:

  https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples 

2- Using scikit-learn library 

Notes: 

1- Most of the codes and data i use in this repository from courses i studied, and this repository shows how i studied
          Machine Learning topics.
       
2- The codes wrote from the scratch is represent how i applied the theroy using numpy, scipy with the help of the guidence
          from the courses i studied.
    
3- All the codes is written in python 3.6

4- Most of the codes include descreption for how to use the  models in general:

a- initiate the model 

b- model.fit(X_train,y_train)

c- model.predict(X_test)
