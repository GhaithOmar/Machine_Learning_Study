1- Choose the number k of clusters
2- Select at random k points, the centroids (not necessarily from your dataset)
3- Assign each data point to the closest centroid --> that forms K clusters
4- Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster 
5- Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid if any
reassignment took place, got to step4, otherwise got fin 

fin ---> your model is ready


choosing the right number of clusters


WCSS =  sum(distance(pi, c1)^2) + sum(distance(pi,c2)^2)+ ...+sum(distance(pi,cn))

pi point in each cluster
C is the centroid related for to each cluster
