Thompson Sampling:

step 1: at each round n, we consider 2 numbers for each ad i:

#Ni1(n) - the number of times the ad i got reward 1 up to round n 
#Ni0(n) - the number of times the ad i got reward 0 up to round n 

step 2: For each ad i, we take a random draw from the distribution below:
	Thetai(n) = Beta(Ni1(n) + 1 ,Ni0(n)+1)

step 3: We select the ad theat has the highest Thetai(n)
