1 - Make each data point a single-point cluster --> That forms N clusters
2 - Take the two closest data points and make them one cluster --> That forms N-1 clusters
3 - Take the two closest clusters and make them one cluster --> That forms N-2 clusters
4 - Repeat step 3 until there is only one cluster 
5- if there is only one cluster go to fin 


Distance between clusters
