PCA 

From the m independent variables of your dataset, PCA extracts p <= m new
independent variables that explain the most the variance of the dataset, 
regardless of the dependent variable.

The fact that the DV is not considered makes PCA an unsupervised model


LDA 

from the n independent variables of your dataset, LDA extracts p <= n new 
independent variables that separatethe most the classes of the dependent variable.

The fact that the DV is considered makes LDA a supervised model
